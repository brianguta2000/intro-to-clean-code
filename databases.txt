1. What data types do each of these values represent?
A: 1- String
   2- integer
   3- date
   4- float
   5- float

2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be
   used.
A: You should use a database when you want the ability to query data efficiently,
   when you have a large amount of data to maintain, and if multiple people will
   be accessing the data, especially at the same time. A text file would suffice
   when using a small amount of data that only you will be working with, no other
   users

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.
A: SQL is a declarative language, not a procedural. You don't have to
   define algorithms, you just tell the database what you want and it will
   get the data for you

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together
   at a high level.
A: Data is stored in tables that are made of Columns (list column name, data
   type, and other column attributes), rows (contain the actual data for the
   columns), and data. Using SQL we can create tables, add data to them, update
   them, and delete data.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.
A: A table is the culmination of all of the values, rows, and columns.
   Each column represents the type of data represented, and a name for the data.
   Each row contains the actual data inside of each column for each record.
   Values are the actual data for the corresponding row and column.

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.
A: String, Integer, Float

     WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data';

   - SELECT userid
     FROM users
     WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu';
