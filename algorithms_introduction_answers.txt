1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

A: Making Coffee:
     
	GET coffee grounds from cupboard
     
	IF coffee basket has old grounds
       
		CLEAR coffee basket of any previous grounds
     
	END IF
     
	IF coffee pot is dirty
       
		WASH coffee pot
     
	END IF
     
	PUT coffee filter in basket
     
	WHILE basket is not full
       
		PUT coffee grounds in basket
     
	END WILE
     
	PUT basket in coffee maker
    
	WHILE coffee maker is not full
      
		FILL coffee maker with water
     
	END WHILE
     
	PUT coffee pot into coffee maker
     
	START brew cycle

   

B: Washing Dishes:
     
	START hot water
     
	GET sponge
     
	ADD soap to sponge
    
	FOR each dirty dish
       
		SCRUB dish with sponge
      
		RINSE dish in water
      
		PUT dish in drying rack
     
	END FOR

   

C: Making Tea:
     
	GET tea bag from cupboard
     
	GET mug from cupboard
    
	PUT tea bag in mug
     
	GET kettle from cupboard
    
	WHILE kettle is not full
       
		FILL kettle with water
    
	END WHILE
     
	PLACE kettle on stove
     
	LIGHT burner on stove
     
	WHILE water is not boiling
      
		HEAT water in kettle
     
	END WHILE
     
	TURN OFF burner
     
	POUR water into mug



2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the
 problem. 
It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation.
   

Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful,
   
e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such
 as a recipe or manufacturing a product). 
Google's algorithm produces more
 relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases
   
make them stand out?


A: Match.com's algorithm for finding compatibility between 2 people seems to have
 made them very successful. 
They are the longest standing dating site I can think
 of, so it must be working well!

   

B: Pinterest's algorithm for providing content based on a users interest and past
 likes is also very successful. 
It has way more users than any other similar platform,
 so it must do a better job determining what it's users want to see.

  
 
C: Netflix uses an algorithm to suggest movies and TV shows you might like based on
 your content history. 
They have a giant collection, and do a great job of curating
 lists of content similar to that.



3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient
 algorithm.


A: An efficient algorithm should solve a problem as quickly and with as little work
 as possible. 
Obviously they should also find an accurate solution. It would also
 help if the logic was clean and easy to follow, 
so that the algorithm is easy to
 update and maintain.
